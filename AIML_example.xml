<!-- 
    The AIML(Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) can be used to create simple chatbots.
    Our goal is to mimic a conversation by expecting what a user might say.

    We split the conversation into small parts called categories.
    In each category we must have a pattern and a template.

    A pattern is used to expect what a user might say, patterns has to be specified in upper case, 
    but it is case insensitive for the user.

    If a user inputs a pattern the chatbot chooses to say the template for that pattern:

    Ex:
        <category>
            <pattern> HELLO </pattern>
            <template> Hello I am a chatbot </template>
        <category>

        A conversation between the user and this bot could look like:

        user: Hello
        chatbot: Hello I am a chatbot
-->

<!-- A category includes a pattern and a template -->
<category>
    <pattern> HELLO </pattern>
    <template>
        <!-- We can use the random tag to define several templates(answers) to a pattern -->
        <random>
            <!-- We have to add all templates to in li(list) tag when using random -->
            <li>Hello</li>
            <li>Hola</li>
            <li>Yo</li>
            <li>How you doing</li>
            <li>Hello <get name = "username"/></li>
        </random>
    </template>
</category>

<!-- We can replay information about the user using the * sign and the star tag -->
<category>
    <pattern>HELLO I AM *</pattern>
    <template>
        Hello <star/>
    </template>
</category>

<!-- We can store information about the user using the * sign and the set tag -->
<category>
    <pattern>MY NAME IS * AND I AM *</pattern>
    <template>
        Hello <set name = "username"> <star index="1"/> </set> you are <star index="2"/>
    </template>
</category>

<!-- We can retrive information about the user using the get tag -->
<category>
    <pattern>BYE</pattern>
    <template>
        Good bye <get name = "username"/>
    </template>
</category>

<!-- Here we want to answe who Albert Einstein is -->
<category>
      <pattern> WHO IS ALBERT EINSTEIN </pattern>
      <template>Albert Einstein was a German physicist</template>
</category>

<!-- Here we want to answer who Isaac Newton is -->
<category>
    <pattern> WHO IS ISAAC NEWTON </pattern>
    <template>Isaac Newton was a English physicist and mathematician</template>
</category>

<!-- Here we can answer that we don't know if the user asks for someone else other than Isaac or Albert-->
<category>
    <pattern> WHO IS * </pattern>
    <template>I'm sorry I dont</template>
</category>

<!-- We can create several patterns for the same templates using the srai tag -->
<!-- Here the user can ask WHO IS as above or DO YOU KNOW WHO IS as above -->
<category>
    <pattern>DO YOU KNOW WHO * IS</pattern>
    <template>
        <!-- Using the srai tag we can route this question to the WHO IS pattern above -->
        <srai>WHO IS <star/></srai>
    </template>
</category>
